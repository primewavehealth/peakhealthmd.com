        is pain that lasts for more than three months. It can be constant or

        Pain can be classified into two main types: acute and chronic. Acute
        pain is sudden pain that is usually caused by an injury or illness. It
        is usually short-lived and goes away once the underlying cause is
        treated. Chronic pain, on the other hand, is pain that lasts for more
        than three months. It can be caused by a variety of conditions, and it
        can be difficult to treat.

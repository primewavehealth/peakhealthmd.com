        <h2>What are the Causes of Erectile Dysfunction?</h2>

        <p className="text-justify ">
         There are several possible causes of ED, both physical and
         psychological. Physical causes of ED include conditions that affect
         blood flow to the penis, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or
         heart disease. Neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis or
         Parkinson's disease can also contribute to ED. Lifestyle factors like
         smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, or drug use can damage blood
         vessels and nerves, leading to ED. Hormonal imbalances, including low
         levels of testosterone, can also cause ED. In addition to physical
         factors, psychological factors can also play a role in ED, such as
         stress, anxiety, depression, or relationship problems. Identifying the
         underlying cause of ED is crucial to developing an effective treatment
         plan.

        <h2>What are the Symptoms of Erectile Dysfunction?</h2>

        <p className="text-justify ">
         Erectile dysfunction, also known as impotence, is a condition where a
         man is unable to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for sexual
         intercourse. The symptoms of erectile dysfunction may vary depending on
         the underlying cause of the condition, but common signs include weak
         erection and reduced sexual desire. Other symptoms may include
         premature ejaculation, delayed ejaculation, or a lack of orgasm

          is a pervasive issue affecting millions of people worldwide. According
          to recent studies, nearly 80% of adults experience lower back pain at
          some point in their lives. This statistic emphasizes the need for a
          comprehensive understanding of the causes, symptoms, and effective

          comprises the spine, a complex structure of vertebrae, intervertebral
          discs, muscles, ligaments, and nerves. The spine, a central support
          column, grants strength and flexibility, while intervertebral discs
          act as shock absorbers. Muscles and ligaments provide stability and
          facilitate movement. The intricate network of nerves relays signals
          between the brain and body. This structural complexity affords the
          back its remarkable strength and flexibility but also makes it
          susceptible to pain when subjected to strain, injury, or poor posture.
          Understanding this anatomy is crucial for addressing and preventing
          issues like lower back pain.

       Common causes of lower back pain
      </h2>
      <div className="mb-4">
       <p>
        There are many possible causes of lower back pain, but the most common
        are:
       </p>
       <ul className="pl-4 mb-8 list-disc">
        <li className="mb-2">
         Muscle strain and overuse: Muscle strain often results from sudden
         movements or lifting heavy objects improperly. Overuse, especially
         without proper conditioning, can lead to chronic issues.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
         Herniated discs: When the gel-like center of an intervertebral disc
         protrudes, it can press on nearby nerves, causing pain and discomfort.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
         Poor posture: Incorrect posture, whether sitting or standing, places
         undue stress on the lower back, contributing to pain over time.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
         Sedentary lifestyle: A lack of physical activity weakens the supporting
         muscles of the lower back, making it more susceptible to pain and
         injury.

        <li className="mb-2">
         Reduced Quality of Life: Individuals with chronic pain often experience
         a diminished quality of life due to the ongoing physical and emotional
         impact.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
         Fatigue: The consistent presence of pain can lead to fatigue and
         exhaustion, affecting daily activities.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
         Mood Changes: Chronic pain is linked to mood alterations, including
         irritability, anxiety, and depression.

         Sleep Disturbances: Sufferers may face difficulties falling or staying

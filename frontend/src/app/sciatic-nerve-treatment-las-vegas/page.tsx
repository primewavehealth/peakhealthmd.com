          is a painful condition that affects millions of people worldwide. It
          is caused by irritation or compression of the sciatic nerve, the

          Anatomy of the Sciatic Nerve
         </h3>
         <p>
          The sciatic nerve is formed by the roots of the L4, L5, S1, and S2
          spinal nerves. It exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen
          and runs down the back of the thigh. The sciatic nerve branches into
          smaller nerves that supply the muscles, skin, and joints of the leg
          and foot.

         Herniated disc: A herniated disc occurs when the inner part of a spinal
         disc ruptures and pushes out through the outer part of the disc. This
         can put pressure on the sciatic nerve and cause pain.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
         Lumbar spinal stenosis: Lumbar spinal stenosis is a narrowing of the
         spinal canal in the lower back. This can put pressure on the sciatic
         nerve and cause pain.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
         Degenerative disc disease: Degenerative disc disease is a condition in
         which the discs in the spine break down and become more susceptible to
         injury. This can lead to a herniated disc or other problems that can
         compress the sciatic nerve.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
         Piriformis syndrome: Piriformis syndrome is a condition in which the
         piriformis muscle, located in the buttocks, spasms and compresses the

         Cauda equina syndrome: Cauda equina syndrome is a rare but serious

       <p>
        The primary symptom of sciatica is pain along the path of the sciatic
        nerve. The pain is typically described as sharp, burning, or tingling.
        It may start in the lower back and radiate down the buttocks, leg, and
        foot. The pain may be worse with certain activities, such as sitting,
        bending, or lifting. Other common symptoms of sciatica include:

       <p>
        There is no single test that can diagnose sciatica. The diagnosis is
        usually made based on a physical examination and a discussion of the
        patient's symptoms. In some cases, diagnostic imaging tests, such as
        X-rays, MRI, or CT scans, may be ordered to help rule out other causes
        of pain.

        Treatment Options for Sciatica
       </h3>
       <p>
        Treatment for sciatica depends on the severity of the symptoms and the
        underlying cause. In most cases, non-invasive treatments, such as rest,
        ice and heat therapy, over-the-counter pain relievers, exercise, and
        chiropractic care, can relieve pain and improve symptoms. In some cases,
        epidural steroid injections or surgery may be necessary.
